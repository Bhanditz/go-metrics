# go-metrics

This package is small wrapper around the prometheus go client to help enforce convention and best practices for metrics collection in Docker projects.

## Docs

Package documentation can be found [here](https://godoc.org/github.com/docker/go-metrics).

## Additional Metrics

Additional metrics are also defined here that are not avaliable in the prometheus client.
If you need a custom metrics and it is generic enough to be used by multiple projects, define it here.
